First go thouth the code and correct if anythings is wrong after that start phase - 8 | 
## Phase 8: Bulk Import
50. **Build import page** (`/import`)
51. **CSV upload** — drag-and-drop zone or file input, parse with `papaparse`
52. **Validation report** — show table of parsed rows, highlight invalid ones (missing tracking number, bad courier code)
53. **Review & confirm step** — user removes bad rows or fixes them, then clicks "Submit"
54. **Progress UI** — show a progress bar as each tracking is submitted to the API
55. **Summary** — show how many succeeded/failed after completion
56. **Handle large files** — process in batches, don't block the UI
57. **Commit:** `"Bulk import: CSV upload, validation, review, progress, batch processing"`

yes commit it

push it

okay lets start phase 9 | 
## Phase 9: Shareable Tracking Pages
58. **Generate a unique `public_slug`** for each tracking (e.g., nanoid or short uuid)
59. **Build public tracking page** (`/track/[id]`):
    - Fetch tracking by `public_slug` where `is_public = true`
    - Show full timeline (no login required)
    - Generate and display a **QR code** linking to this page
60. **Build OG image route** (`/api/og/[id]`):
    - Use Next.js `ImageResponse` (from `next/og`) to generate a dynamic social preview image
    - Show tracking number, status, courier logo
61. **Add `<meta>` OG tags** to the shareable page's metadata
62. **Add public/private toggle** on the history page and tracking result — updates `is_public` in Supabase
63. **Commit:** `"Shareable tracking: public pages, QR code, OG image, privacy toggle"`
