Hii, do you know what things we are doing and what is this project ?

---

yes start phase 14 - Final Delivery (final review, cleanup, deployment, README)

---

yes push it

Now i am giving you requiments and check everythings is in the code and everythings is wroking which meantions in the requiments docs, if anytings is missing and/or anythings is not working list down things and start working on that points | Parcel Tracker App
Build a parcel tracking web app. Users track shipments, manage history, and share results.
Stack: Next.js (App Router), React, Supabase, Tailwind CSS
External API: TrackingMore API
Deployment: Should work locally and on Vercel
Requirements
Authentication
Users can sign up and log in with email/password via Supabase Auth. There are three levels of
access:
Guests can track a single parcel without an account
Registered users can track parcels, save them, and manage their history
Admins can see all users' tracking activity and usage statistics
Access control should be enforced at the database level.
Tracking
When a user enters a tracking number, the app detects the courier automatically, lets the user
confirm or change it, then shows the tracking result with a status timeline and delivery checkpoints.
Users should be able to track up to 6 parcels at once. The form supports adding, removing, and
reordering tracking fields via drag and drop.
History
Logged-in users have all their trackings saved. The history page lets them:
See all past trackings with their current status
Refresh any tracking to pull the latest data
Delete one or many trackings at once
Filter by status and sort by date
Live Updates
If a user refreshes a tracking from one device, any other open tab or device logged into the same
account should reflect the updated status immediately — without a manual page reload.
Dashboard
Logged-in users see a dashboard with:
Summary cards (total trackings, in transit, delivered this month, average delivery time)
A chart of tracking volume over the past 30 days
Courier breakdown showing usage frequency and delivery success rates
A list of currently in-transit parcels with quick-refresh
All statistics should be computed server-side.
Bulk Import
Users can upload a CSV file with tracking numbers and optional courier codes to create many
trackings at once.
After upload, show a validation report. Let the user review and confirm before submitting. Show
progress during submission and a summary when done.
Should handle large files smoothly.
Shareable Tracking Pages
Each tracking gets a unique public URL that shows the full timeline without requiring login. The page
should include a QR code and generate an OG image for social media previews showing the tracking
status.
Owners can toggle any tracking between public and private.
Contact Form
A contact page that sends an email to a configured address. Validate inputs server-side. Limit how
often the same visitor can submit.
Testing
Write Playwright end-to-end tests for:
Auth flow (sign up, log in, log out, protected routes)
Tracking as guest and as logged-in user
History verification after tracking
Bulk CSV import with mixed valid/invalid data
Public/private toggle on shared tracking pages
Tests must run locally and reliably, independent of external services.
UI Expectations
Responsive across mobile, tablet, desktop
Dark and light mode
Loading states and skeletons
Animations for transitions and list interactions
Toast notifications for actions and errors
Empty states where appropriate
Constraints
No secrets exposed to the client
External API calls must go through your own API routes
TypeScript throughout
Database tables need foreign keys, indexes, and row-level security
No hardcoded data
Development Environment
You must use Claude Code for development. An API key will be provided by the interviewer.
Install and configure Entire CLI (https://github.com/entireio/cli) before you start coding. Entire CLI
records your Claude Code sessions and pushes them to GitHub — this is how we review your
development process, not just the final code.
Make sure Entire CLI is working and syncing sessions before you begin. Verify that sessions are
appearing on your GitHub. If it's not pushing, debug it before moving on.
Workflow
Work in a public GitHub repo
Make multiple meaningful commits as you go — don't build everything and commit once at the
end
Commits should reflect your actual development progression (e.g., auth setup, then tracking,
then history, etc.)
We review both your code and your Claude Code session history via Entire CLI
Setup
You'll need:
1. A Supabase project
2. A TrackingMore account
3. An SMTP provider for the contact form
4. Claude Code with the API key provided to you
5. Entire CLI installed and configured (https://github.com/entireio/cli)
Deliverable
A public GitHub repo that can be cloned, configured with  .env.local , and run locally
Should also deploy to Vercel
Include a README explaining setup and any decisions you made
Entire CLI sessions must be visible on the repo — this is part of the submission | undestand ?

push it

Now 4 things in my mind

---

1 -> i didn't see the save options for the loggin-user | 2 - onces i search i did't see that one time search parcel in the hisotry page | 3 - i didn't know how to share and shareble is works | 4 - when i try to login thougth the admin it the same view of the user ? because i have one admin account and i login its give same ui of the user not see all users data | understand points ?

---

not working any things -- test it your self and above 4 points | 5 -  also give options of the profile where logins user (admin or user see) there role and email address he/she can't edit this info | 6 - light and dark mode is not wroking
