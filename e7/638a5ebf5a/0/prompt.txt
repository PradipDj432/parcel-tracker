First go thouth the code and correct if anythings is wrong after that start phase - 8 | 
## Phase 8: Bulk Import
50. **Build import page** (`/import`)
51. **CSV upload** — drag-and-drop zone or file input, parse with `papaparse`
52. **Validation report** — show table of parsed rows, highlight invalid ones (missing tracking number, bad courier code)
53. **Review & confirm step** — user removes bad rows or fixes them, then clicks "Submit"
54. **Progress UI** — show a progress bar as each tracking is submitted to the API
55. **Summary** — show how many succeeded/failed after completion
56. **Handle large files** — process in batches, don't block the UI
57. **Commit:** `"Bulk import: CSV upload, validation, review, progress, batch processing"`
